# READ ME


# IDEA
Lua Tools is a repository and a site to make Lua more accessible. it contains a Lua minifier and a Lua executor what does Lua minifier and Lua executor compact in one site.
# CREDITS
For Lua executor it's fengari, the LuaVM in JavaScript. huge respect to the creator for his patience with the project and in general for the fact that this project exists. For the Lua minifier it's luamin. its creators are geniuses, because there is a high chance that the source code contains the grammar and syntax of Lua on JavaScript. I couldn't do that and I'm grateful to them for that.
# LICENSE
Fork repository how many you want and do whatever you want with this repository. the main thing is to indicate credits to my repository and to credits relative to me. Please I can't track you but leave the credits :(. I will be offended if someone forks my project, improves it and does not indicate credits under the pretext of `"I am the original"`
# LANGUAGES
It's easier to say the main site with Lua executor not translated but Lua Minifier is translated to Russian and English.
# COOPERATION
I am happy to cooperate with anyone.
